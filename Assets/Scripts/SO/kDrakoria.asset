  description: Carved into the treacherous peaks of jagged mountains, Drakoria exudes
    an aura of brooding mystery and formidable strength. Darkened skies perpetually
    hang over the land, veiled in shadows cast by soaring dragon roosts. The kingdom's
    inhabitants, resilient and steadfast, have forged an unbreakable bond with these
    magnificent beasts, becoming formidable dragon riders and skilled guardians of
    ancient knowledge buried deep within the mountain caverns.
