  description: Nestled deep within lush forests, Eldoria thrives as the kingdom of
    eternal enchantment. Its towering ancient trees whisper secrets of forgotten
    magic, while majestic unicorns roam freely, their shimmering horns casting a
    soft glow on the realm. The realm is renowned for its wise and ancient elven
    council, whose guidance and unwavering connection to nature have preserved the
    delicate balance between the mortal and mystical realms.
