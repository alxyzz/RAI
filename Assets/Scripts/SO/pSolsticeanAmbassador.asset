  description: This ambassador is a celestial figure, with a porcelain complexion
    and hair that shimmers like starlight. Clad in flowing robes of iridescent blue,
    their very presence evokes a sense of otherworldly tranquility. As their feet
    glide above the ground, they emanate a faint luminescence, symbolizing the power
    of the astral realm. With words imbued with cosmic wisdom, they seek to bridge
    the gap between the mortal realms and the celestial plane.
